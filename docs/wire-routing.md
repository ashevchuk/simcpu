# Wire routing algorithms (stand / future rewrite)

Status: **stand + tidy/commit integration**. Production tidy/commit/ribbon use
`router: 'channel'` (escape → A\*). Rubber-band draw still uses the L/Z pattern
catalog. Run `npm run test:routing` and `npx vitest run test/route-channel.test.ts`.

Goal for the stand: pin→pin orthogonal routes that

1. leave each pin along its natural exit direction,
2. avoid component body AABBs,
3. prefer few bends and short total length,
4. never introduce 45° segments,
5. play well with explicit waypoints and T-junction nodes.

## Current pipeline (what ships today)

```
raw polyline (pin → waypoints → pin)
        │
        ▼
routeWirePoints()
  ├─ pinExitDir(start/end) from body center
  ├─ per segment: routeSegmentSmart()
  │     ├─ collectPatternCandidates()  // L / Z / exit stubs
  │     ├─ pickBestPath(score)
  │     └─ if still hits bodies → routeAStar() on GRID
  └─ simplifyOrthoPath()
```

| Piece | Role |
|-------|------|
| `pinExitDir` | Unit axis away from component center through the pin |
| `orthogonalPoints` / HV·VH | Single-corner L between two points |
| `collectPatternCandidates` | Catalog of L/Z + escape stubs for start/end dirs |
| `pickBestPath` | Score length, bends, obstacle penetration |
| `routeAStar` | Coarse grid maze; null if window too big / blocked |
| `simplifyOrthoPath` | Drop colinear / duplicate verts |
| `routingObstacles` | Body AABBs for the active circuit |
| `findWireCrossings` | Cosmetic H×V solder dots (not topology) |

**Pain points observed in lab tutorials**

- Stub catalog often wins over A* even when a cleaner maze path exists.
- Obstacles are axis-aligned boxes only — no “channel” preference between chips.
- Multi-waypoint wires only smart-route first/last legs; middle stays crude L.
- Commit-time auto-tidy can fight manual bends the user just placed.

## Stand algorithms (`stands/wire-routing`)

Headless harness: pins + AABBs in, polyline out, golden fixtures, SVG dump.

```bash
npm run test:routing
npx vite-node stands/wire-routing/src/dump.ts ribbon-4 --out /tmp/ribbon.svg
```

### A. Pattern-first with hard obstacle veto (small change)

1. Generate the same L/Z/stub catalog.
2. **Reject** any candidate that intersects an obstacle interior (not merely score higher).
3. If none remain → A*.
4. If A* fails → longest clear stub + L to the other pin.

Acceptance: no segment midpoint inside a body AABB.

### B. Escape-then-channel (implemented in stand)

1. **Escape:** from each pin, walk `exitDir` until clear (+ min stub). Skip forced stub when the target lies against the exit dir.
2. **Channel A\*** on GRID from escape(start) to escape(end):
   - length = 1 per step
   - bend (direction change) = 2.5
   - occupied trunk (fanout) = 6
3. **Simplify** colinear / overshoot verts; attach pin stubs.

State is `(cell, incomingDir)`. Fixtures: `face-to-face`, `around-body`, `ribbon-4`, `junction-tee`.

### B.1 Pin escape lanes (post-drag artifacts)

Dragging a chip drops the waypoints of half-attached wires, so mouseup re-runs
`tidySelectedWires` and every route is rebuilt from scratch. Two rules keep that
rebuild from producing the stubs and stair-steps users reported:

- **Candidate shapes follow the pin axes, not the span aspect.** A pin firing
  E/W always starts the route horizontally, so a vertical jog on (or beside) its
  own column is never proposed — that jog is the "stair right after the pin".
  Facing pairs get one rail (`from → (railX, from.y) → (railX, to.y) → to`),
  perpendicular pairs get a single corner.
- **Its own package is an obstacle for the maze.** Endpoint bodies are excluded
  from `obstacles` so pin stubs can leave them; they are passed separately as
  `hostObstacles` and block the channel A\*, which otherwise tunnelled through a
  chip to reach a pin from the wrong side.

Both the shape candidates and the maze result are ranked by one metric
(`scorePath`): bends, length, jogs inside a pin's clearance (graded, so a
congested gap degrades to the next lane instead of a multi-bend detour),
long runs hugging a pin column, backtracking, and colinear overlap with
already-routed wires. Rails come from up to four free channels around the gap
centre, so fan-ins spread instead of stacking.

Regression cover: `test/route-drag-tidy.test.ts` (move COUNTER4 in
`examples/lab-counter-7seg.json`, then tidy) and
`npx vite-node stands/wire-routing/src/dragRepro.ts <example.json> <NAME> <dx> <dy>`
for an ad-hoc dump of every wire on the moved part.

### C. Visibility / rectilinear visibility graph

Later: inflate obstacles, Steiner at corners, shortest ortho path. Use when grid A\* is too coarse/slow.

### D. Incremental / local repair (editor UX)

On drag: re-route only affected segments; keep explicit waypoints.

## Exit criteria before merging back to geometry.ts

- [x] Fixture suite: zero body intersections (`npm run test:routing`)
- [x] Latch + counter + BUF8 fixtures from real examples
- [x] Facing exits ≤ 3 bends (`face-to-face`)
- [ ] Explicit mid-waypoints preserved under tidy of other legs
- [x] Drop-in behind `routeWirePoints` for tidy/commit/ribbon (`router: 'channel'`)
- [x] Perf: &lt; 2 ms/route stand microbench

Rubber-band draw still uses the pattern catalog on purpose (keeps drag cheap).
Next: waypoint preservation, then optionally channel for rubber-band too.
